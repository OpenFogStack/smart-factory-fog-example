## Instructions

Use the `Makefile` to build and push services as Docker containers.
Adapt the `REPO` variable to your Docker repo.
Then use `make all -B` or `make [service name] -B` to build and push all services or a specific service.
[If your system supports it](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Parallel.html), use `make all -B -j` to build and push all services in parallel.

Alternatively, you can also build binaries directly by going into the directory of a service and running `go build .` (Go in version >= 1.13 is required).
